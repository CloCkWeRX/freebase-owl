GOAL:
Model and integrate all of http://www.langual.org/langual_linkcategory.asp?CategoryID=4&Category=Food+Composition

TASKS:
    * Resolve licensing agreements with Aust. government for rights to reproduce data (in progress)
    * Model Canadian data
    * Find or create a suitable ontology for Nutrition data (I would have expected some common terms from the bio-rdf community, but I don't have the background to know what I'm looking for)
    * Model the USDA, NUTTAB and Canadian extensions as appropriate
    * Find or create a list of terms used in nutrition data (shorthand/abbreivations) - ie CBODF = "Carbohydrate by difference", but I can't seem to find a good list of these outside of the USDA data itself.
    * Create owl:sameAs links to DBPedia topics in some automated fashion - this is tricky, because a lot of the data is written as "Cheese, blue" and is much more granular than wikipedia articles about Cheese.
    * Create owl:sameAs links to Freebase topics in some automated fashion - ditto
    * Interlink Canadian, NUTTAB, USDA data in some automated fashion - similar - different naming schemes make using dc:title as a IFP a bit annoying.
    * Render full sets of RDF for each
    * Publish these somewhere - http://lauken.com/doconnor/ is not suitable for anything more than a sandbox
    * Provide human interfaces as appropriate - if anyone wanted to create shiny XSLT -> XHTML perhaps; or PHP glue...
    * Setup a SPARQL endpoint (I have a hell of a time doing this in my development environment, so this might not happen) - HELP!
    * Provide unit test coverage for all generator tools
    * Refactor lots
      * Remodel as 'measurements' and 'measurement_type' using OBO, MGED and other upper level science ontologies where plausible
